# 100-Days-Of-Code---Day-4-Project
My fourth project created during the "100 days of code" Python bootcamp. Third one is uploaded too. 
Been following the course for 4 days now.
Today, the project was to create a rock paper scissors game using the 'Random' module and lists in Python.

Hope you enjoy :)
